1.) $to
Receiver's email address. As specified in the PHP docs, the receiver's email address should take the following formats

user@example.com
user@example.com, anotheruser@example.com (Sending to multiple users)
User <user@example.com> (Specifying the user's username)
2.) $subject: 
The subject of the email to be sent

3.) $message: 
The message. Each line should contain no more than 70 characters. Each line should be separated with a CRLF (\r\n). You could solve this simply by wrapping the message text around the PHP wordwrap() function. Like so:

$message = wordwrap($message, 70);
4.) $headers:
This one is optional. But If you want to do some styling on the email you send, you must specify the Content-Type in the header as text/html;charset=UTF-8 to tell email clients to parse the email as HTML.
